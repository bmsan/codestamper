CodeStamper aims to help the user in ensuring traceability between ML experiments and code.



## 1.1. Description
When running ML experiments one would want to be able to replicate a past experiment at any point in time. One aspect to achieve this(although not the only one) is to be able to run the exact same code version.

### 1.1.1. When things go wrong. An ML experiment is started but it might not be  reproducible in the future because:

from codestamper import Gitstamp

GitStamp().raise_if_dirty()
```

### 1.3.2. Log the current code state
```py

GitStamp().log_state('./experiment/code_log', modified_as_patch=True, unpushed_as_patch=True)
```

  }
}
```

- `mod.patch`

Contains modifications(staged/or unstaged) of git tracked files

The modifications can be applied in an workspace over the commit hash mentioned in the `code_state.json`
```bash
# Make sure we are at the right commit
git checkout <git.hash from code_state.json>

# Add uncommited changes to the workspace
git apply mod.patch
```

- `unpushed<last_pushed_commit_hash>-<last_unpushed_commit_hash>.patch`

Contains the delta between the current commit and last pushed commit.
This should be used only in the unlikely event when the unpushed commits get lost.
It should be considered an experimental last resort feature.


```bash
# Make sure we are at the right commit
git checkout <last_pushed_commit_hash>

# Add uncommited changes to the workspace
git apply unpushed<last_pushed_commit_hash>-<last_unpushed_commit_hash>.patch
```

- `pip-packages.txt`

Contains a list of pip packages and their versions as seen by the pip freeze command. If the project is using conda or poetry using the env files generate for them is prefered.

- `conda_env.yaml`

If Conda is used, this file will be present and will contain the exported Conda env in yaml format.
The enviroment can be recreated using : `conda env create -n ENVNAME --file conda_env.yml`

- `poetry.lock`

The file will be generated if the project is using poetry as package manager.
