# GitStamp

Gitstamp aims to help the user to ensure traceability(and reproduceability) between ML experiments and code.

## Description
When running ML experiments one would want to be able to replicate a past experiment at any point in time. One aspect to achieve this(although not the only one) is to be able to run the exact same code version.

Ideally the code for an experiment is versioned under a commit. In real life in certain situations accidents might happen:
 - Code modifications were staged but not commited
 - One modified file was missed when commiting
 - The code is commited, but the code never gets pushed 
 - Even if all the code is versioned re-running the same experiment 8 months from now might not work the same because the the implementation/API of the imported packages has changed 

Gitstamp to the rescue. It can:
- Prevent running experiments before having all the local modifications versioned on git.
- Log any local changes not caught in a commit.
- Log contents of commits not already Pushed
- Log current python enviroment state

## Examples

### Enforce a clean workspace
```py
GitStamp().raise_if_dirty()
```

### Log the current code state
```py
GitStamp().log_state('./experiment/code_log', modified_as_patch=True, unpushed_as_patch=True)
```
```

    }
  }
}
```

- `mod.patch`

Contains modifications(staged/or unstaged) of git tracked files

The modifications can be applied in an workspace over the commit hash mentioned in the `code_state.json`
```bash
# Make sure we are at the right commit
git checkout <git.hash from code_state.json>

# Add uncommited changes to the workspace
git apply mod.patch
```

- `unpushed<last_pushed_commit_hash>-<last_unpushed_commit_hash>.patch`

Contains the delta between the current commit and last pushed commit.
This should be used only in the unlikely event when the unpushed commits get lost.
It should be considered an experimental last resort feature.


```bash
# Make sure we are at the right commit
git checkout <last_pushed_commit_hash>

# Add uncommited changes to the workspace
git apply unpushed<last_pushed_commit_hash>-<last_unpushed_commit_hash>.patch
```
